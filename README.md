Participated in the Falcon Hackathon hosted by Lablab.ai, where I contributed to UX wireframe design using Figma, an innovative educational platform. I helped build a responsive and user-friendly website that enhanced the learning experience. Our project was recognized for its innovative approach and user-centric design. This experience strengthened my skills in web development, teamwork, and problem-solving.
